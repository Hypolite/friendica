{"name":"Friendica","tagline":"Friendica Communications Platform - MIT license","body":"### The internet is our social network\r\n\r\nFriendica is an open source software that implements a distributed social network. It is running on the popular LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Think WordPress or Drupal, but for social. It is a mature platform with over two years of development behind it, and provides a wide range of connectors to both legacy and indie social networks. Your \"friends\" can be from App.net, Diaspora, GNU Social, Pump.io or Twitter. You can import RSS feeds and post to Facebook, Libertree, Wordpress, Tumblr, Google+ pages and more. You can even interact via mail.\r\n\r\nWhy Friendica? Because somebody has to stand up for the people of the Internet.  This is why we exist. Friendica is our alternative to those \"creepy\" social networks that don't really care about your privacy, and only seem to care how they can profit from taking it away. They seem to be constantly making it harder for your social communications to actually reach your friends and families, and easier for unwanted people to sell you stuff. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
